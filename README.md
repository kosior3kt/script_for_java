## What is this thing?
this is very simple script for unshittifying Java (v hard task). 
It copiles everything that contains .java recursively from place of 
execution and then moves results to places specified in "package \<someBullShit.god_why\>;"

if folders are nowhere to be found it creates them.

It moves only .class files.

## Usage
Just run the script in ./build.sh.
After that you can clean it up with ./clean.sh

if you want to test if it's running you can run ./build.sh -r
this will build and run main executable.

## Disclaimer
It comes with ABSOLUTLEY NO GUARANTEE. Use it only if you are brave
